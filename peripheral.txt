SPI_CR1

Bit 15 BIDIMODE: Bidirectional data mode enable
0: 2-line unidirectional data mode selected
1: 1-line bidirectional data mode selected
Note: This bit is not used in I2S mode

Bit 14 BIDIOE: Output enable in bidirectional mode
This bit combined with the BIDImode bit selects the direction of transfer in bidirectional mode
0: Output disabled (receive-only mode)
1: Output enabled (transmit-only mode)
Note: This bit is not used in I2S mode.
In master mode, the MOSI pin is used while the MISO pin is used in slave mode.

Bit 10 RXONLY: Receive only
This bit combined with the BIDImode bit selects the direction of transfer in 2-line
unidirectional mode. This bit is also useful in a multislave system in which this particular
slave is not accessed, the output from the accessed slave is not corrupted.
0: Full duplex (Transmit and receive)
1: Output disabled (Receive-only mode)
Note: This bit is not used in I2S mode

SPI_CR2


SPI_I2SCFGR
Bit 11 I2SMOD: I2S mode selection
0: SPI mode is selected
1: I2S mode is selected
Note: This bit should be configured when the SPI or I2S is disabled

command		meaning
0x23		read button state
0x45		set LED state


holding register->shift reg->send out

slave interrupt state machine
S1=set to S2 before readButtonData function
S2=send garbage back
S3=get button data and send back
S4=disable interrupt
